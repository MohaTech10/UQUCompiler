# UQUCompiler

---
##### UQULang MIPS compiler, A programming language inspired by Swift, Java.

- It is a simple compiler written in java to teach me and other students about compilers.

--- 
Currently, UQULang is only being developed by me, Mohammed.

` the language is not to be taken seriously in any kind of way at this moment, since it's just another fun project of mine` 


### Example of what UQULang should look like at the end 
```
var globalInt : int = 10;
var areYouReadingThis: bool = true;
func int main(i: int, args: string[]) {
    print("Hello, World");
    return 0;
}
```

> Note: This project is still under development, So that's why I'm keeping what the code of this language should look like.
