var x: int = 10 + x * y;

// x: binType(ADD);  10 + bin(x, y, mul);
tree is exactly like this now;
    +
  /   \
10     *
      / \
     x   y

// using post order algorithm:  will be left, right, root

will be 10 then right 10xy*+; this is how it's, and then we need kinda a stack for postfix to analyze it.
