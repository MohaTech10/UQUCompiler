# This folder should keep track of what is not supported.

### I don't want to be confused with the language shape. So I made a list of what will be ignored.

> Careful : These features can be implemented later


#### Not Supported Yet: 
- nested scope
- let declaration
- struct declaration `Very soon ? once the lang sees the light`
- pointers 
- 64bit Support

---
##### Again this will be for now, Any contribution to resolve those features are WELCOME.

For now I will be completely ignore them as I don't be confused and build and learn iteratively
